# simple-ios-temp-converter

A project from Grant Klimaytys's Udemy course. The original project just converts celsius to fahrenheit. I thought it would be a nice challenge to give the user the option to convert from C to F or from F to C. Had to add a switch statement and a couple of extra variables to make it work. Only tested on the Xcode 8 simulator for ios 10.
